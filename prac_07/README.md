# Practical 07

## Overview
This repository contains the practical exercises for the CP1404 subject. The practicals focus on applying programming patterns and principles of clean code to create efficient, readable, and maintainable code.

## About Me
My name is Khant Zay Yar, and I am a student learning the principles of programming. Through this subject, I aim to improve my coding practices and understand the importance of clean code and programming patterns.

## Lessons Learned About Clean Code
- Code Readability: Writing code that is easy to read and understand by using meaningful variable names and consistent formatting.
- Simplicity: Keeping the code simple and avoiding unnecessary complexity. This makes the code easier to maintain and debug.
- Refactoring: Regularly improving the structure of the code without changing its functionality. This includes breaking down large functions into smaller, more manageable pieces and removing redundant code.
